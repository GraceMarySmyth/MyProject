I study at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/).

I am currently in the first semester of Data Analytics.

# As per the submission guidlines as laid out by Lecturer Ian McLoughlin the tasks are as below:
1. Create a GitHub repository with a README.md and a .gitignore. Add a Jupyter notebook called penguins.ipynb and add a title to it.
2.  Find the palmerpenguins data set online and load it into your Jupyter notebook. In your notebook, give an overview of the data set and the variables it contains.
3.  Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model the variables in the data set in Python, explaining your rationale.
4.  Create a bar chart of an appropriate variable in the data set. Then create a histogram of an appropriate variable in the data set.

# The main body of the project 
Select two variables from the data set and provide an analysis of how correlated they are.
